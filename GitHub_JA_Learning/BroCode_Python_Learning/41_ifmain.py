# if__name__ = __main__:  (This Script can be imported OR run standalone)
# Functions and classes in this module can be resused
# without the main block of code executing

# Good practice of this would be: ( code is modular, helps readability, leaves no global variables, avoid unintended execution.)

# example of this would be a library = Import library for functionality 
# when running library directly, display a help page

    # INPUT PROGRAM HERE
