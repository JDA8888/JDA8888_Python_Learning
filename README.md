 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey** — a personal, version-controlled record of my growth and progress in Python programming.  
This repository documents my hands-on practice, mini-projects, and key concepts learned along the way as I transition from a Structural Engineer to a Software Engineer.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as both:
- 🧠 A **learning log** of Python fundamentals and advanced topics I’ve studied.
- 💻 A **portfolio of practical exercises and projects** that show how I’ve applied these concepts.

I began this journey to build a strong foundation in programming logic, data structures, algorithms, and automation, with the goal of applying these skills in software development, data engineering, and technical problem-solving.
